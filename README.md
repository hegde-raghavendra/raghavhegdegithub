### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I am a software engineer and an eager to learn student with a keen interest in web technologies and IBM mainframe area.** 

It sure will feels like an odd combination for most of you but let me explain.. I started my career in mainframe and then transition to web based technologies. I have done a lot of work in bridging the mainframe world to the web world by enabling the CICS gateways to call API and creating APIs in Java and postgres which in turn are called by REXX and mainframe. Currently I am in the process of moving some of the legacy applications written in PL1, DB2 and IMS screens over to web application where frontend is written in react and backend in Java spring boot on Pivotal cloud foundry.
